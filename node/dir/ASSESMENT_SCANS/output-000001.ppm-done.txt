1 PURPOSE OF THE WORK

The Polytechnic University of Tirana seeks to modernize critical components of the infrastructure where digital

services are offered by requesting the replacement of the existing firewall devices ASA 5512 which are no longer

produced and will no longer be supported with warranty and development by the manufacturer Cisco with two

new firewalls new generation!

The modernization of the current system of information filtering at the entrance and exit of the network, increases

the security param to contemporary standards through the deployment of new generation firewall equipment as

well as the application of tested and predetermined practices!

Firewalls are essential to the institution because they act as a barrier between the internal network and the

Internet, preventing unauthorized access to its resources and data.

The latest generation firewalls use a set of rules to filter and block traffic that does not meet specified security

criteria, such as incoming traffic from known malicious IP addresses or web pages as well as outgoing traffic to

unapproved or disreputable sites.

Also these devices can segment the network by applying access rights to certain groups of users at different

levels!

Also, these devices can help prevent unauthorized access, data corruption, and cyber attacks, helping to keep

the institution's networks and information secure. For this reason, the need for firewalls is essential as these

devices protect sensitive information, apply enforced policies to internal users in accordance with predetermined

rules to protect the institution's reputation.

The Polytechnic University of Tirana seeks to increase data storage capacities with a new storage which should

offer high processing capacities and meet the growing demands for access to data. The necessity for this

solution comes as a result of the increasing daily tasks and addressing the data storage needs of the institution

in a device which must be able to

handle even more demands at once for the current load and what will be added to it

the future!

First, the data storage solution must offer scalability, allowing for the addition of more capacity in the future as

the institution's data needs grow without having to replace the entire system. This will help the university avoid

disruptions caused by exceeding their current storage capacity.

Second, data storage solutions must offer high availability and reliability. These systems must use redundant

components and advanced data protection techniques to ensure that data is always available and protected,

even in the event of a physical device failure or disaster.

Third, data storage solutions should offer higher performance than traditional storage solutions, ensuring faster

access to data and reducing latency. This is especially important for historical data that is only incremental and

requires real-time access.

Finally, data storage solutions should provide advanced data management capabilities, including deduplication,

compression, and encryption, which help the university to
